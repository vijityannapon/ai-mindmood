# Frontend: AI MindMood

Welcome to the **AI MindMood** frontend! This project is the user interface for the **AI Sentiment Analysis** application that allows users to input text and receive sentiment predictions. The frontend is built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## üîß Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have **Node.js** installed. You can download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijityannapon/ai-mindmood.git
cd ai-mindmood/frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Before running the project, you need to create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` template. Follow these steps:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the newly created `.env` file and update the values with your settings:
   
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
   VITE_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=en
   ```

   - **`VITE_API_URL`**: The URL of the backend API for sentiment analysis.
     - Example: `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (default backend URL).
   
   - **`VITE_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`**: The default language of the app. You can set it to `en` for English or `th` for Thai.
     - Example: `en` (default language).


### 4. Start the development server

To run the application locally, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## üìù Features
